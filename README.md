## Drug Sales Analysis: Unveiling Insights into Revenue Trends

In an era of data-driven decision-making, the ability to extract meaningful insights from datasets is paramount. This report delves into a comprehensive analysis of drug sales, providing invaluable insights into revenue trends, top-performing drugs, and teams. The project focuses on a four-year dataset encompassing Germany and Poland, with a core objective of unraveling the nuances of drug sales performance.

### Data Set Overview
The dataset used in this analysis stems from the SideHustle 7.0 internship training. The data, comprising 254,083 rows and 17 columns, offers a holistic view of various aspects, including distributor information, customer details, geographical data, product specifics, and sales metrics.

### Business Goals
The analysis serves several key objectives:
- **Revenue Analysis**: Understanding the revenue generated over the specified timeframe.
- **Top Performers Identification**: Identifying the best-performing drug class, top 7 drugs by revenue, and the most successful sales team.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To ensure accuracy and reliability, data cleaning was meticulously executed. Duplicates were eradicated, transactions with zero drug quantities were removed, and a new column named "Status" was introduced to classify transactions as sales or returns based on the nature of the sales value.

### Analytical Insights
The heart of the analysis lies in the insights extracted from the data. Pivot tables were employed to facilitate descriptive analysis, resulting in a wealth of key findings:
- **Yearly and Monthly Revenue**: The year 2018 emerged as the most lucrative, generating a staggering revenue of $3,506,897,354, and August took the lead in monthly revenue with $1,186,627,360.
- **Top Revenue Generators**: The pharmacy sub-channel stood out as the highest revenue generator. The drug "Ionclotide" and the drug class "Analgesics" reigned supreme, amassing revenue of $169,083,391 and $2,371,515,114, respectively.
- **Returns Exploration**: The drug "Abatatriptan" witnessed the highest quantity of returns, totaling 3367 units. However, the reason for these returns remained undocumented.

### Visual Representation and Insights Sharing
To enhance the sharing of findings, visual representations were generated within the spreadsheet. Charts, and graphs were employed to present the data-driven insights in an accessible and comprehensible manner.

### Challenges and Limitations
As with any analysis, challenges were encountered:
- **Return Reason Absence**: The lack of recorded reasons for drug returns poses a challenge in understanding the underlying causes.
- **Poland Data Limitation**: With only one year's worth of data for Poland (2018), drawing definitive conclusions about the country's sales trends is restricted.

### Future Prospects
This analysis serves as a stepping stone for future endeavors. By refining data collection and incorporating return reason documentation, deeper insights into customer behavior can be obtained. Moreover, expanding the dataset for Poland would enable more accurate trend analysis.

In conclusion, this drug sales analysis amalgamates the realms of data analysis and pharmaceuticals. Armed with a biochemistry background and adeptness in data tools, the analyst presents a thorough investigation into revenue trends, drug performance, and sales teams.
